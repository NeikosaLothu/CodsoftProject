Internship Projects at CodSoft

This repository contains the projects I completed during my internship at CodSoft. The projects cover fundamental programming concepts such as logic implementation, user interaction, and object-oriented programming in Java.

Projects Overview

1. Number Guessing Game
   
A simple console-based number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a given range.

Features:

Random number generation between 1 and 100.

Limited attempts (default: 5 tries) to guess the number.

Feedback provided on whether the guess is too high or too low.

Option to play multiple rounds.

Score tracking based on successful guesses.

Technologies Used:
Java

Scanner for user input

Random number generation

How to Run:

Compile the code:

javac NumberGuessingGame.java

Run the program:

java NumberGuessingGame


2. Student Grade Calculator
   
A program that calculates a student's total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on their performance.

Features:

Takes input for marks in multiple subjects.

Validates marks to ensure they are within the range of 0-100.

Calculates total marks and average percentage.

Assigns grades based on the percentage achieved.

Displays final results including total, percentage, and grade.

Technologies Used:

Java

Input validation using loops

Conditional logic for grading

How to Run:

Compile the code:

javac StudentGrade.java

Run the program:

java StudentGrade


3. ATM Interface
   
A console-based ATM simulation that allows users to check their balance, withdraw, and deposit money securely.

Features:

Secure and menu-driven interface.

Options to check balance, deposit, and withdraw money.

Input validation to prevent incorrect transactions.

Initial balance set to â‚¹5000 (modifiable in code).

User-friendly messages for successful or failed transactions.

Technologies Used:

Java

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Scanner for user input

How to Run:

Compile the code:

javac AtmMachine.java

Run the program:

java AtmMachine
